## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A working installation of your static site generator (e.g., Hugo, Jekyll)
- Basic knowledge of using the command line
- A text editor

## Installing Saral for a New Project

### Step 1: Create a New Project

First, create a new project using your static site generator. For example, if you're using Hugo:

```bash
hugo new site my-new-site
cd my-new-site
```

### Step 2: Add the Saral Theme

Next, add the Saral theme as a Git submodule or download it directly.

#### Using Git Submodule

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/yourusername/saral.git themes/saral
```

#### Downloading Directly

Alternatively, you can download the theme and extract it to the `themes` directory:

```bash
mkdir themes
cd themes
wget https://github.com/yourusername/saral/archive/main.zip
unzip main.zip
mv saral-main saral
rm main.zip
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Configure the Theme

Open the `config.toml` file in your project and add the following line to set Saral as the theme:

```bash
theme = "saral"
```

### Step 4: Build and Serve the Site

Finally, build and serve your site to see the Saral theme in action:

```bash
hugo serve
```

Your new site should now be running with the Saral theme.

## Installing Saral for an Existing Project

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Project Directory

Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your existing project:

```bash
cd path/to/your-existing-site
```

### Step 2: Add the Saral Theme

Add the Saral theme as a Git submodule or download it directly.

#### Using Git Submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/yourusername/saral.git themes/saral
```

#### Downloading Directly

Alternatively, you can download the theme and extract it to the `themes` directory:

```bash
mkdir themes
cd themes
wget https://github.com/yourusername/saral/archive/main.zip
unzip main.zip
mv saral-main saral
rm main.zip
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Configure the Theme

Open the `config.toml` file in your project and add the following line to set Saral as the theme:

```bash
theme = "saral"
```

### Step 4: Customize the Theme

If your project has custom configurations or content, you may need to update your configurations or migrate content to fit the Saral theme's structure. Refer to the Saral theme documentation for specific instructions.

### Step 5: Build and Serve the Site

Build and serve your site to see the Saral theme in action:

```bash
hugo serve
```

Your existing site should now be running with the Saral theme.
