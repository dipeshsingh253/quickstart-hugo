2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm aims to find patterns or structure in the data, such as grouping similar data points together. Clustering algorithms are common in unsupervised learning.

3. **Reinforcement Learning:** In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with an environment, taking actions to maximize a cumulative reward. The agent learns to make a sequence of decisions to achieve a specific goal, as seen in robo
